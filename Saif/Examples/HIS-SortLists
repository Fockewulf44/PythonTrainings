# # As an introduction to sorting lists in Python you'll have to implement two functions.
# In this exercise we represent students as a pair of (mark, full_name), so a tuple of two elements.
# And in this exercises we represent students as lists of pairs, like:
# >>> students = [(85, "Susan Maddox"), (6, "Joshua Tran"), (37, "Jeanette Wafer")]
# Part 1
# Write a function named sort_by_mark that take as argument a list of students and returns a copy of it sorted by mark in descending order. Such as:
# >>> sort_by_mark(students)
# [(85, "Susan Maddox"), (37, "Jeanette Wafer"), (6, "Joshua Tran")]
# Part 2
# Write a function named sort_by_name that take as argument a list of students and returns a copy of it sorted by name in ascending order, such as:
# >>> sort_by_name(students)
# [(37, "Jeanette Wafer"), (6, "Joshua Tran"), (85, "Susan Maddox")]
# https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html

students = [(85, "Susan Maddox"), (6, "Joshua Tran"), (37, "Jeanette Wafer")]

list.sort()

def sortbymark(students):
    sortbyname = split.students()
    names = len(sortbyname)
