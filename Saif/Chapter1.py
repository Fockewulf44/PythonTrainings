# If you are familiar with other computer languages, you may be used to terminating every line with asemicolon. 
# There is no need to do so in Python. A line is a line, more or less. You may add a semicolon if you like, but 
# it won’t have any effect (unless more code follows on the same line), and it is not a common thing to do.

# print("Hello, world!")

#  help() for python modules, keywords, symbols, or topics. 

# Algorithms consist of a series of instructions to be followed in order. Some of the instructions may be done directly (“take some SPAM”), while some require
#  some deliberation (“If a particularly spicy SPAM is desired”), and others must be repeated several times (“Check every 10 minutes.”)

# Recipes and algorithms consist of ingredients (objects, things) and instructions (statements). In this
# example, SPAM and eggs are the ingredients, while the instructions consist of adding SPAM, cooking for a
# given length of time, and so on.
